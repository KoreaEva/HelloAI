        "# Whisper prompting guide\n",
        "\n",
        "OpenAI's audio transcription API has an optional parameter called `prompt`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The prompt is intended to help stitch together multiple audio segments. By submitting the prior segment's transcript via the prompt, the Whisper model can use that context to better understand the speech and maintain a consistent writing style.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, prompts do not need to be genuine transcripts from prior audio segments. _Fictitious_ prompts can be submitted to steer the model to use particular spellings or styles.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook shares two techniques for using fictitious prompts to steer the model outputs:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Transcript generation**: GPT can convert instructions into fictitious transcripts for Whisper to emulate.\n",
        "- **Spelling guide**: A spelling guide can tell the model how to spell names of people, products, companies, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "These techniques are not especially reliable, but can be useful in some situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Comparison with GPT prompting\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompting Whisper is not the same as prompting GPT. For example, if you submit an attempted instruction like \"Format lists in Markdown format\", the model will not comply, as it follows the style of the prompt, rather than any instructions contained within.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the prompt is limited to only 224 tokens. If the prompt is longer than 224 tokens, only the final 224 tokens of the prompt will be considered; all prior tokens will be silently ignored. The tokenizer used is the [multilingual Whisper tokenizer](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py#L361).\n",
        "\n",
        "To get good results, craft examples that portray your desired style."

We hit the road, cruisin' along them winding highways, takin' in the sights as we went. I tell ya, the scenery up there was somethin' else. Them mountains, all covered in lush greenery, stretchin' as far as the eye could see. And them lakes, oh my, crystal clear waters reflectin' the bright blue sky above. We made a pit stop in Portland, a quaint little coastal town. We strolled along the cobblestone streets, takin' in the salty breeze comin' off the ocean. And the seafood, well, it was out of this world! We had ourselves a feast, with lobsters as big as my hand and clams so fresh they practically jumped right outta the shell. We couldn't resist tryin' some of that famous Maine blueberry pie, and let me tell ya, it was like a taste of heaven. We ventured up to Acadia National Park, hikin' them rugged trails and takin' in the breathtaking views from the mountaintops. The air up there was so crisp and clean, it felt like a whole different world. We even spotted some of them adorable little puffins, bobbin' along in the ocean waves. And let's not forget about Bar Harbor, a charming little town nestled right by the water. We spent our evenings strollin' along the harbor, watchin' the boats come in and out, and indulgin' in some more of that delicious seafood. Maine sure did steal a piece of our hearts, my friend. It was a vacation we'll never forget, that's for sure.\n"
